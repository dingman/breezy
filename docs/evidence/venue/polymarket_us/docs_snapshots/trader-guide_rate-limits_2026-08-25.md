# Rate Limits

> API rate limits and best practices for integration

The Polymarket US API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and system stability. All limits are **per participant firm** unless stated otherwise.

## REST API

### Trading Endpoints

REST API traffic is subject to a **firm-wide cap of 100 requests per second per firm**, averaged over a 1-minute window. This means short bursts above 100 req/sec are permitted as long as the average stays within budget. Some REST endpoints may also enforce additional lower limits, such as the query/report endpoints listed below.

### Query / Report Endpoints

In addition to the firm-wide REST cap above, these read-heavy endpoints have lower per-firm limits. Cache responses where noted.

| Endpoint           | Limit      | Notes                               |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `GetTradeStats`    | 60 req/min | Heavy aggregation query             |
| `ListInstruments`  | 6 req/min  | Static data - cache client-side     |
| `ListSymbols`      | 6 req/min  | Static data - cache client-side     |
| `GetOrderBook`     | 12 req/min | Prefer streaming for real-time data |
| `GetBBO`           | 12 req/min | Prefer streaming for real-time data |
| `SearchOrders`     | 12 req/min | Use filters to narrow results       |
| `SearchExecutions` | 12 req/min | Use filters to narrow results       |
| `SearchTrades`     | 12 req/min | Use filters to narrow results       |

### Combos Endpoints

In addition to the firm-wide REST cap above, Combos endpoints have these per-firm limits:

| Endpoint      | Limit       | Notes                                |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `GetCombos`   | 100 req/sec | Exact combo lookup                   |
| `CreateCombo` | 1 req/sec   | Create or retrieve a canonical combo |

### RFQ Endpoints

RFQ endpoints have these per-firm limits:

| Endpoint       | Limit       | Notes                                           |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `GetRFQUserID` | 1 req/sec   | RFQ user ID lookup                              |
| `GetRFQs`      | 10 req/sec  | Prefer `StreamRFQEvents` for live RFQ changes   |
| `GetQuotes`    | 10 req/sec  | Prefer `StreamRFQEvents` for live quote changes |
| `CreateRFQ`    | 1 req/sec   | RFQ creation                                    |
| `DeleteRFQ`    | 100 req/sec | Close an open RFQ                               |
| `CreateQuote`  | 200 req/sec | Quote creation                                  |
| `DeleteQuote`  | 200 req/sec | Quote deletion                                  |
| `AcceptQuote`  | 100 req/sec | Quote acceptance                                |
| `ConfirmQuote` | 100 req/sec | Last-look quote confirmation                    |

Each row above has a separate per-firm endpoint bucket with one second of burst capacity. Traffic to one method does not consume another method's endpoint-specific allowance, although broader firm-wide and edge limits still apply.

### Public (Unauthenticated) Endpoints

| Limit                   | Value     |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| Max requests per second | 20 per IP |

## gRPC Streaming

| Setting                                             | Value       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Max concurrent streams per firm                     | 20          |
| Ingress message rate (per firm, across all streams) | 100 msg/sec |
| `StreamRFQEvents` new stream opens per firm         | 1/sec       |
| Egress (server to client)                           | Unlimited   |

Ingress rate is averaged over a 1-minute window, allowing short bursts. Exceeding the average limit will result in throttled or rejected messages. This limit applies to all participants.

The `StreamRFQEvents` limit is checked only when opening a stream. It does not limit server-pushed RFQ or quote events on an established stream.

## FIX Protocol

| Setting              | Value                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Ingress message rate | 150 msg/sec per session |

FIX rate limiting is enforced at the FIX gateway level. This limit applies to all participants.

## Rate Limit Response

When rate limited, the REST API returns:

```json theme={null}
{
  "code": 8,
  "message": "rate limit exceeded",
  "details": []
}
```

**HTTP Status:** `429 Too Many Requests`

### Retry Strategy

When receiving a 429 response:

1. Stop making requests immediately
2. Wait 1 second before retrying
3. Implement exponential backoff for repeated 429s
4. Consider reducing your request rate

```python theme={null}
import time

def make_request_with_retry(url, headers, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 429:
            wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # 1, 2, 4 seconds
            print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {wait_time}s...")
            time.sleep(wait_time)
            continue

        return response

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

## Latency Stopgap on Orders

During periods of increased latency, Polymarket US applies a **5-second stopgap** to inbound orders. If an order has been received by Polymarket US but has not been processed within 5 seconds, we reject it to protect you from a bad fill at a stale price.

<Warning>
  These rejects carry the message **`Global Rate Limit Exceeded`**, but they are **not** an actual rate limit. You do **not** need to throttle your traffic in response to them. Treat them as a transient latency reject, not a signal to back off.
</Warning>

What it applies to:

* **New orders** — rejected if not processed within 5 seconds.
* **Order modifications via cancel/replace** — also subject to the stopgap.
* **Pure cancels are not affected** — a standalone cancel is never rejected by this stopgap.

You can always cancel an order before you have received an acknowledgement, and even before it has been processed.

## Best Practices

### Use Streaming Instead of Polling

The API is designed as a **streaming-first** system. Instead of repeatedly polling for updates, subscribe to real-time streams:

| Don't Poll                                        | Use Streaming Instead                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Repeated calls to `/v1/report/orders/search`      | `CreateOrderSubscription` gRPC stream      |
| Repeated calls to `/v1/rfqs` or `/v1/rfqs/quotes` | `StreamRFQEvents` gRPC stream              |
| Repeated calls to `/v1/positions`                 | `CreatePositionSubscription` gRPC stream   |
| Repeated calls to `/v1/orderbook`                 | `CreateMarketDataSubscription` gRPC stream |

<Info>
  Streaming connections don't count against the REST rate limit. One streaming connection can replace hundreds of polling requests. New `StreamRFQEvents` connections are limited to one open attempt per second per firm, so reconnect with backoff.
</Info>

### Cache Reference Data

Reference data (instruments, symbols, metadata) changes infrequently - `ListInstruments` and `ListSymbols` are limited to just 6 req/min. Cache responses locally:

```python theme={null}
class InstrumentCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.instruments = {}
        self.last_refresh = None

    def get_instrument(self, symbol):
        # Refresh cache every 5 minutes
        if self._needs_refresh():
            self._refresh_instruments()
        return self.instruments.get(symbol)

    def _needs_refresh(self):
        if not self.last_refresh:
            return True
        return (time.time() - self.last_refresh) > 300

    def _refresh_instruments(self):
        response = api.list_instruments()
        for inst in response.instruments:
            self.instruments[inst.symbol] = inst
        self.last_refresh = time.time()
```

### Batch Operations

Where possible, batch your operations instead of making individual requests:

* Use `SearchOrders` with filters instead of fetching orders one by one
* Use `ListInstruments` with symbol filters instead of individual lookups
* Subscribe to multiple symbols in a single streaming connection

## Monitoring Your Usage

Track your request patterns to stay within limits:

```python theme={null}
import time
from collections import deque

class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, max_requests=100, window_seconds=1):
        self.max_requests = max_requests
        self.window = window_seconds
        self.requests = deque()

    def can_make_request(self):
        now = time.time()
        # Remove old requests outside the window
        while self.requests and self.requests[0] < now - self.window:
            self.requests.popleft()
        return len(self.requests) < self.max_requests

    def record_request(self):
        self.requests.append(time.time())

    def wait_if_needed(self):
        while not self.can_make_request():
            time.sleep(0.05)  # 50ms
        self.record_request()
```

## Abuse Prevention

Patterns that may result in temporary or permanent restrictions:

* Sustained requests above the rate limit
* Polling for data available via streaming
* Requesting the same unchanged data repeatedly
* Automated retry loops without backoff

<Warning>
  Abuse of the API may result in temporary or permanent restrictions on your API credentials. Contact [onboarding@polymarket.us](mailto:onboarding@polymarket.us) if you need higher limits for legitimate use cases.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Rate Limits

### Consistently Hitting Limits

If you're consistently receiving 429 errors:

* Reduce request frequency
* Batch multiple operations where possible
* Cache responses that don't change frequently (reference data, instrument lists)
* Use streaming endpoints instead of polling
* Contact support to discuss higher rate limits for production use

### Need Higher Limits

For production use cases requiring higher limits:

1. Document your use case and expected volume
2. Contact support at [onboarding@polymarket.us](mailto:onboarding@polymarket.us)
3. Provide environment (dev, preprod, prod)
4. Specify which endpoints you need higher limits for
